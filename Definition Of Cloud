Clouds are pools of virtual resources, such as processing power, storage, or cloud base application orchestrated by management and 
automation software so they can be accessed by users on-demand through some self-service portals supported by automatic scaling and
dynamic resource allocation.
Virtual resources needs to be allocated into centralized pools before they are called clouds and those clouds need to be orchestrated by
management and autonmation software before it's considered cloud computing.
Cloud deliver the added benefits of self-service access, automated intfrastructure scaling and dynamic resource pools, which distinguishes 
it form traditional virtualization.


IaaS: Bare minimum hardware and software needed to deploy a cloud: Servers, Storage , Network and Virtualization. Each of these services
can be scaled, provisioned and metered atomatically, while every other part of the IT stack - from OS to application, must be managed by
consumers.


PaaS: All hardware and software that Iaas provides alongwith the OS, middleware and runtime environment.
