Clouds are pools of virtual resources, such as processing power, storage, or cloud base application orchestrated by management and 
automation software so they can be accessed by users on-demand through some self-service portals supported by automatic scaling and
dynamic resource allocation.

IaaS: Bare minimum hardware and software needed to deploy a cloud: Servers, Storage , Network and Virtualization. Each of these services
can be scaled, provisioned and metered atomatically, while every other part of the IT stack - from OS to application, must be managed by
consumers.

PaaS: All hardware and software that Iaas provides alongwith the OS, middleware and runtime environment.
